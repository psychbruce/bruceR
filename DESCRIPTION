Description:
    Broadly useful convenient and efficient R functions
    that bring users concise and elegant R data analyses.
    This package includes easy-to-use functions for
    (1) basic R programming
    (e.g., set working directory to the path of currently opened file;
    import/export data from/to files in any format;
    print tables to Microsoft Word);
    (2) multivariate computation
    (e.g., compute scale sums/means/... with reverse scoring);
    (3) reliability analyses and factor analyses;
    (4) descriptive statistics and correlation analyses;
    (5) t-test, multi-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA),
    simple-effect analysis, and post-hoc multiple comparison;
    (6) tidy report of statistical models
    (to R Console and Microsoft Word);
    (7) mediation and moderation analyses (PROCESS);
    and (8) additional toolbox for statistics and graphics.
